## Goal: 
Analyze Covid Data and see the impact on various industries whether restaurant / stocks / farm. Also use news data to better understand how news around Covid may impact as well.

The CDC data tells us individual cases by day, which we'll need to aggregate, but we can use that info to see how it impacted the restaurant / farm data on a quarterly / annual basis.

We can also use the news api to see how the news cycle regarding covid may have impacted businesses as well. We can also get news about vaccinations

Additionally, we can check stocks of various companies within each industry to see how they may have been impacted.

The question if we can predict any trends / waves that coronavirus cases / immunizations / newscycles can impact finances on specific industries.
